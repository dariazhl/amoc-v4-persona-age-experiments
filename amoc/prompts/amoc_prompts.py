- Example: "thing describes charlemagne" is ALWAYS INVALID because "thing" cannot perform the action "describes"
- Generic words can only be objects, never subjects
- If the subject is a generic word, the triple is automatically INVALID

**VALIDATION RULES:**
- The triple must be EXPLICITLY STATED in the sentence
- The subject must be the actual doer of the action in the sentence
- The object must be the actual receiver of the action
- If the sentence says "man wrote about king", then:
  - ✓ (man, wrote about, king) is VALID
  - ✗ (thing, describes, charlemagne) is INVALID because "thing" is not the subject
  - ✗ (king, wrote about, man) is INVALID (wrong direction)
  - ✗ (man, knows, king) is INVALID ("knows" not in sentence)

Respond with a JSON object containing:
1. "valid": true or false
2. "reason": a brief explanation of your decision (1 sentence)
3. "corrected_triple": if you think the triple is almost correct but needs adjustment (e.g., wrong direction, or replacing a generic word with a more specific one from context), provide the corrected (subject, relation, object) as a list. Otherwise, null.

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Relationships involving main characters (Charlemagne, his family, kingdoms, etc.) should generally score 4-5
- Generic relations like "relates to", "is associated with" should score lower (1-2) unless they carry specific meaning
- Vague placeholders ("thing", "certain", "good") used as subjects or objects lower the score
- A relationship that connects an isolated node to the main graph is valuable even if the relation itself is generic
- **Do NOT** suggest removing a relationship if it's the only connection between a node and the rest of the graph

Return a JSON object mapping each triple to its score:
{{
    "scores": {{
        "(subject1, relation1, object1)": 4,
        "(subject2, relation2, object2)": 2,
        ...
    }},
    "to_remove": ["(subject1, relation1, object1)", ...],
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of pruning strategy"
}}

Only include in "to_remove" relationships that score 1-2 AND are not the sole connection for any node.
